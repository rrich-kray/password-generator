In this day and age, securing your accounts with strong, randomized passwords is essential to maintaining peace of mind. With the Random Password Generator, users can create fully customized and completely random passwords that will secure their information from cyber criminals.

## Usage

The Random Password Generator was designed with simplicity of use in mind. By pressing the 'generate password' button, the user will be presented with a series of prompts that allows them to customize their password.

If invalid input is provided, the user will be presented with the following prompt and must reenter their input.
